## 📘 About This Repository

This is my structured portfolio documenting my progress across multiple CS50 courses inspired by Harvard University's curriculum.  
Each course contains:

- Weekly problem sets (with explanations and code)
- A final project
- Notes
- Git history showing continuous improvement

The purpose of this repository is to track real learning, build a provable portfolio, and demonstrate commitment and skill growth.
